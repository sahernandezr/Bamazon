# Bamazon

This is an Amazon-like storefront using CLI.

## Client side

The app shows the customer the list of products in the store and ask what products does they want to buy and how many units.

If there are not enough units on stock, the app notifies the customer.

If there are enough units on stock, the app accepts the order, shows the customer the total amount paid and updates the available inventory in the database.
